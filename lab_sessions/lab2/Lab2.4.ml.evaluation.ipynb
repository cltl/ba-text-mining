The goal is to classify a textual unit, e.g., word, lemma, sentence, document, etc., into some category. It is essential that we evaluate NLP systems thoroughly, which gives us insight into their strengths and weaknesses. In this notebook, we show how to compute the most crucial evaluation metrics, which are Precision, Recall, and F<sub>1</sub> or F-measure.\n",
