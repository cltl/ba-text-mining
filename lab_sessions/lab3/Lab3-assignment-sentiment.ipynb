    "This notebook describes the LAB-2 assignment of the Text Mining course. It is about sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aims of the assignment are:\n",
    "* Learn how to run a rule-based sentiment analysis module (VADER)\n",
    "* Learn how to run a machine learning sentiment analysis module (Scikit-Learn/ Naive Bayes)\n",
    "* Learn how to run scikit-learn metrics for the quantitative evaluation\n",
    "* Learn how to perform and interpret a quantitative evaluation of the outcomes of the tools (in terms of Precision, Recall, and F<sub>1</sub>)\n",
    "* Learn how to evaluate the results qualitatively (by examining the data) \n",
    "* Get insight into differences between the two applied methods\n",
    "* Get insight into the effects of using linguistic preprocessing\n",
    "* Be able to describe differences between the two methods in terms of their results\n",
    "* Get insight into issues when applying these methods across different  domains\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you are going to create your own gold standard set from 50 tweets. You will the VADER and scikit-learn classifiers to these tweets and evaluate the results by using evaluation metrics and inspecting the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend you go through the notebooks in the following order:\n",
    "* **Read the assignment (see below)**\n",
    "* **Lab3.2-Sentiment-analysis-with-VADER.ipynb**\n",
    "* **Lab3.3-Sentiment-analysis.with-scikit-learn.ipynb**\n",
    "* **Answer the questions of the assignment (see below) using the provided notebooks and submit**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you are asked to perform both quantitative evaluations and error analyses:\n",
    "* a quantitative evaluation concerns the scores (Precision, Recall, and F<sub>1</sub>) provided by scikit's classification_report. It includes the scores per category, as well as micro and macro averages. Discuss whether the scores are balanced or not between the different categories (positive, negative, neutral) and between precision and recall. Discuss the shortcomings (if any) of the classifier based on these scores\n",
    "* an error analysis regarding the misclassifications of the classifier. It involves going through the texts and trying to understand what has gone wrong. It servers to get insight in what could be done to improve the performance of the classifier. Do you observe patterns in misclassifications?  Discuss why these errors are made and propose ways to solve them."

    "**Comparison:**\n",
    "Firstly, we will compare how well the models perform when with and without lemmatizing the text. Since the data is balanced considering the 3 classes have similar instances, namely 1750, 1515, and 1490 for negative, neutral, and positive respectively, we will focus on the macro average instead of the weighted average, however, the micro average, or the accuracy, will be used for an overall comparison of performance, regardless of class. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the basic model, the precision has a macro average of 0.65, while the recall is 0.63, leaving the f1_score at 0.62, and the accuracy, or micro average at 0.63. While, for the basic model with lemmatizing the text, the precision is 0.65, recall is 0.63, f1_score of 0.62, and accuracy of 0.62. This means the difference between the models is only evident in the accuracy score, however since the difference is only 0.01, we will consider that lemmatizing the text has no effect on the basic model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the model concerning the adjectives, the model without lemmatizing the text has a precision of 0.65, recall of 0.52, and f1_score of 0.48, which the accuracy is 0.50. While the same model but with lemmatized text, the precision is 0.65, recall is 0.52, f1_score is 0.48, and accuracy is 0.50. Similar to the previous situation, the comparison between lemmatized and none-lemmatized shows that lemmatizing the text has no effect on the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the model concerning the nouns, the model without lemmatizing the text has a precision of 0.54, recall of 0.43, and f1_score of 0.38, which the accuracy is 0.42. While the same model but with lemmatized text, the precision is 0.53, recall is 0.43, f1_score is 0.39, and accuracy is 0.42. Similar to the previous situations, the comparison between lemmatized and none-lemmatized shows that lemmatizing the text has no effect on the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, For the model concerning the verbs, the model without lemmatizing the text has a precision of 0.58, recall of 0.48, and f1_score of 0.45, which the accuracy is 0.47. While the same model but with lemmatized text, the precision is 0.56, recall is 0.47, f1_score is 0.45, and accuracy is 0.47. Similar to the previous situations, the comparison between lemmatized and none-lemmatized shows that lemmatizing the text has no effect on the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can conclude that lemmatizing the text only has no effect on the model's performance, especially in the accuracy as it's always the same in both models of lemmatizing and none-lemmatizing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, we compare the performances between the models, in which the comparison will be divided upon comparing the models with lemmatized text and models without. In the case of none-lemmatized text, the model with the most precision is the model that filters on the adjectives part-of-speech, and the basic model with the same 0.65 precision. However, the nouns and verbs models have significantly lower precision with a difference of 0.70 and 0.11 difference. The verbs model is the higher of the two with again a 0.02 difference between it and the nouns model. However, when considering the recall of the models, the basic model performs significantly better than the other three, with a 0.11 difference between the adjectives model, 0.20 with the nouns model, and 0.15 with the verbs model. However, when we check the f1_scores of the models, we can conclude that the basic model performs much better than the other models, which is supported by the accuracy comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now looking at the models with lemmatized text, we can see the same pattern of the basic model performing better than the others overall, with the adjectives model being second, followed by the verbs model then the nouns model.\n",
    "\n",
    "A reason for this observation could be that since tweets are normally short, only focusing on parts of the sentence does not allow the model to perform well, and the reason for the nouns model performing the worst is because the nouns usually do not give a good indication of the label of a sentence or tweet, but rather give context. Similarly, verbs do not give a good indication of the nature of the tweet, unless it's an extreme verb like crashed would be negative or smiled would be positive but most verbs would be neutral like walked, said, etc. Similarly, with lemmatizing text, it doesn't have much of an effect on the label of the text as for example crash and crashed are both negative, and hence returning the word to its base/dictionary form doesn't have much of an effect on how positive, negative, or neutral it is."

    "1. For the negative documents, I expected words in their negated form, showed by the output \"n't\" and more punctuation. For the neutral documents, I expected words that would be used more frequently, so the name of the airlines was a good fit to this. Lastly, for the positive documents, I expected words of appreciation or just positive words in general, and the output contained words related to \"thank you\" and also punctuation. Punctuations in both positive and negative were to be expected as they are normally used when conveying emotions, as we don't need them in a neutral setting, they also don't appear as much.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. There are no words that I didn't expect, given that all of the outputs relate to their categories. Perhaps, I didn't expect punctuation, such as question marks, to have such a high scoring in neutral documents. However, this can be liked to just asking a direct question to the airline.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Even though punctuation can be very expressive, it is easier to understand in context. For example, exclamation marks have a high scoring in both postive and negative settings, so it is hard to analyze why they are there with just this information. Therefore, I would remove punctuation in order to improve the readability and understandability of the model. I would also consider removing \"@\" symbols as they are just used to tag the airline in a tweet and the name of the airlines themselves as they will always appear, don't matter the context."
