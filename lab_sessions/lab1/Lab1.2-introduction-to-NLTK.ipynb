    "In this notebook, we will use the [Natural Language Toolkit](https://www.nltk.org/) to perform various Natural Language Processing tasks including sentence splitting, stop word recognition, and Named Entity Recognition (NER). The Natural Language Toolkit is a python package that provides easy access to [popular corpora and lexical resources](https://www.nltk.org/book/ch02.html#tab-corpora). Also, it contains a wide range of text processing modules (hence the name **toolkit**). NLTK is perfect for getting started with Natural Language Processing since it allows you to study each NLP task separately, which means that you can analyze the input, the algorithm, and the output.  NLTK is an open source and community-driven project."
