    "Text data is unstructured. But if you want to extract information from text, then you often need to process that data into a more structured representation. The common idea for all Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools is that they try to structure or transform text in some meaningful way. Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sentence splitting:** splitting texts into sentences\n",
    "* **Tokenization:** splitting texts into individual words\n",
    "* **Stop words recognition:** identifying commonly used words (such as 'the', 'a(n)', 'in', etc.) in text, possibly to ignore them in other tasks\n",
    "* **Part-of-speech (POS) tagging:** identifying the parts of speech of words in context (verbs, nouns, adjectives, etc.)\n",
    "* **Morphological analysis:** separating words into morphemes and identifying their classes (e.g. tense/aspect of verbs)\n",
    "* **Stemming:** identifying the stems of words in context by removing inflectional/derivational affixes, such as 'troubl' for 'trouble/troubling/troubled'\n",
    "* **Lemmatization:** identifying the lemmas (dictionary forms) of words in context, such as 'go' for 'go/goes/going/went'\n",
    "* **Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD):** assigning the correct meaning to words in context\n",
    "* **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** identifying people, locations, organizations, etc. in text\n",
    "* **Constituency/dependency parsing:** analyzing the grammatical structure of a sentence\n",
    "* **Semantic Role Labeling (SRL):** analyzing the semantic structure of a sentence (*who* does *what* to *whom*, *where* and *when*)\n",
    "* **Sentiment Analysis:** determining whether a text is mostly positive or negative\n",
    "* **Word Vectors (or Word Embeddings) and Semantic Similarity:** representating the meaning of words as rows of real valued numbers where each point captures a dimension of the word's meaning and where semantically similar words have similar vectors (very popular these days)\n",
