    "# Introduction to spaCy\n",
    "\n",
    "Copyright: Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Faculty of Humanities, CLTL\n",
    "\n",
    "[spaCy](https://spacy.io/) provides a rather complete NLP pipeline (the output of one module feeds to the input of the next): it takes a raw document and performs tokenization, POS-tagging, stop word recognition, morphological analysis, lemmatization, sentence splitting, dependency parsing and Named Entity Recognition (NER). It also supports similarity prediction, but that is outside of the scope of this notebook. The advantage of spaCy is that it is really fast, and it has a good accuracy. In addition, it currently supports multiple languages, among which: English, German, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian and Dutch. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will show you the basic usage. If you want to learn more, please visit spaCy's website; it has extensive documentation and provides excellent user guides. \n",
    "\n",
    "**At the end of this notebook, you will be able to extract the output from spaCy for the following NLP tasks**:\n",
    "* **Sentence splitting**: attribute **sents** of a `Doc` (of type *spacy.tokens.doc.Doc*)\n",
    "* **Tokenization**: `Doc` contains a sequence of `Token` objects (of type *spacy.tokens.token.Token*)\n",
    "* **Part-of-speech (POS) tagging**: attributes **pos_** and **tag_** of `Token`\n",
    "* **Stop words recognition** attribute **is_stop** of `Token`\n",
    "* **Stemming and lemmatization**: attribute **lemma_** of `Token`\n",
    "* **Constituency/dependency parsing:** attributes **dep_** and **head**\n",
    "* **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** attribute **ents** (of type *spacy.tokens.span.Span*) of `Doc` (of type *spacy.tokens.doc.Doc*). \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you will be able to use spaCy to visualize the output for each NLP task.\n",
    "\n",

On this page, it is explained exactly how to install spaCy for your operating system, package manager and desired languages. Simply run the suggested commands in your terminal ([Anaconda Prompt](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/) or cmd). \n",
