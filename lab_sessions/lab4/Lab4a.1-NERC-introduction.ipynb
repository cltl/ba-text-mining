    "Despite the token level representation of features and tags in the CoNLL format, we can consider NERC as a typical sequence tagging task. There is a strong dependency within a sentence across words and their tags. A sequence of words (a phrase) predicts the next seuqnece of words and the same can be said for a sequence of tags, reflecting named entity expressions or not. On top of that there can be hard constraints. We cannot have a I-tag with a different type following another I-tag in case of an IOB annotation.\n",

CSV stands for comma-separated-values and it is a commonly used format to exchange e.g. Excell or spreadsheet data as text files. Instances of data are represented on separate lines followed by values separated by commas. Another format is tab-separated-values or TSV, in which case tabs are used as in the CoNLL formats. Very often people store TSV formats in files with the extension \".csv\", so it is always good practice to check the actual content to see what is used as a separator. The first line of a CSV or TSV file is usually the header that labels the different columns. \n",
